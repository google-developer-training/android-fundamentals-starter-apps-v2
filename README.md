Android Developer Fundamentals (Version 2) Starter Apps
=======================================================

This repository contains the code for starter apps for Version 2 of
the  Android Developer Fundamentals course, published by the Google
Developer Training Team.

A “starter app” is an app that you need to download and open in
Android Studio at the start of a lesson. It contains code that you
will modify as you work through a lesson. A starter app is an app that
you did not create yourself in any previous lesson in this course.

Not all lessons in this course use starter apps.

Code for all the other apps in this course are in a different repository.

Introduction
------------

Each of the samples in this repository is associated with a practical
exercise from the Android Developer Fundamentals course. While each
sample stands and runs on its own, they are designed to be used
together with the course.

The Android Developer Fundamentals course is an instructor-led training
experience and is targeted towards beginning Android developers with a
background in software development or computer science.

Pre-requisites
--------------

The samples, along with the course, assume basic competence in software
design and development, as well as some background in computer science.

Specifically, to get started you need:

- Familiarity with the general software development process for object-oriented
applications using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
- At least 1-3 years of experience with object-oriented programming and
the Java programming language.

For the more advanced samples, it helps to know about:

- SQLite databases and the SQLite query language.
- Software architectural patterns that separate data from the user interface,
such as MVP, MVC, or MVA.
- Threading

You don't need to know anything about Android to get started.

Getting Started
---------------

1. [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html),
if you don't already have it.
2. Download the sample.
2. Import the sample into Android Studio.
3. Build and run the sample.
